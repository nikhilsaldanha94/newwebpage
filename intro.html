		<h3>Bio</h3>
		<p>Dr. Nikhil has been engaged with learning for several years and reading and learning
		could be described as his greatest passion. While his father imbued him with a need 
		for excellence, his mother was his ethical compass. Choosing to follow the Indian stereotypical
		requirement, and his own vaguely articulated interest, he began his career by studying medicine. He completed 
		his MBBS degree in St. John's Medical College only to realize that healthcare was not designed to 
		provide care to those who needed it most</p><br>
		<p>Undeterred by what could have been seen as a wasted 6 years of his life, he focused on psychology
		as the panacea through which the challenges in healthcare could be dealt with. So he studied psychology
		for a year and then Health Psychology for another year as his Master's degree. Alas, he found that 
		psychology had issues of its own. However, it had also created avenues from which to better improve systems
		of healthcare in the country - particularly for chronic diseases. This was not adequate, however. The 
		use of psychology to support individuals who needed healthcare required a lot of investment of time and labour
		to create and maintain. This process seemed impossible. However, returning to India, Nikhil then began a tertiary
		investigation into technology. Software and AI offered a path that could allow the integration of psychological
		tools for the creation of large-scale projects. This could potentially suppport individuals with needs 
		that current healthcare systems did not currently provide for.
		But technology that is new and innovative requires building. Individuals and groups of people who gather to do this work
		Nikhil researched, are called startups and entrepreneurs.</p><br>
		<p>Assured he was now following a path which no idiot would ever follow him down and quietly gratified that
		he was uniquely predisposed to this most insane of tasks, Nikhil decided to continue. While he has no idea
		where he is going to go next, he is now deeply invested in learning Python, R, Product Design, Business Analytics,
		Marketing, and Entrepreneurship. He is now nose-deep in a quicksand of learning, but also finds himself oddly content.
		He has no idea where he will go next. And perhaps, that is for the best... or not.</p>
		<p>After all, THE FATE OF THE WORLD ...does not depend on him.</p>
